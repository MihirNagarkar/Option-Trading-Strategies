# Option-Trading-Strategies
This repository contains a Python implementation of options trading strategies. It features a comprehensive analysis of payoff diagrams and breakeven points for various spot price scenarios. Users can input parameters such as strike prices and premiums to visualize the potential profit and loss outcomes of their strategies.
There may be better ways to code the strategies & the codes might not be the most optimal. 

However, if you are looking to freshen the fundamentals &/or for somewhere to begin python scripting in finance with, this can be a good place to start ;)
